    "Certainly! Let's go through each question and provide solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q1: Difference between t-test and z-test\n",
    "\n",
    "**T-Test Example:**\n",
    "Suppose you want to compare the exam scores of two different classes, each consisting of 20 students. Since the sample size is relatively small, you might use a t-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Z-Test Example:**\n",
    "Imagine you are analyzing the weights of all male adults in a town with a population size of 100,000. Since the sample size is large, and you have the population standard deviation, a z-test might be appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2: One-tailed vs. Two-tailed tests\n",
    "\n",
    "**One-tailed Test Example:**\n",
    "If you are investigating whether a new drug increases blood pressure but not decreases it, you would use a one-tailed test.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two-tailed Test Example:**\n",
    "If you are examining whether a new teaching method has a different effect on student performance, you would use a two-tailed test.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3: Type 1 and Type 2 errors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Type 1 Error Example:**\n",
    "In a legal context, if you wrongly convict an innocent person (rejecting the null hypothesis that the person is innocent when they are), it is a Type 1 error.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Type 2 Error Example:**\n",
    "Conversely, if you fail to convict a guilty person (failing to reject the null hypothesis that the person is innocent when they are not), it is a Type 2 error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4: Bayes's Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bayes's Theorem Example:**\n",
    "Consider a medical test for a rare disease. If the test is 99% accurate (sensitivity and specificity), and the disease is rare (1% prevalence), Bayes's theorem can help calculate the probability of having the disease given a positive test result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5: Confidence Interval\n",
    "\n",
    "**Confidence Interval Example:**\n",
    "For a sample of 100 individuals with an average height of 65 inches and a standard deviation of 3 inches, a 95% confidence interval for the true population mean height would be calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6: Bayes' Theorem Probability Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Problem:**\n",
    "If you know that 5% of people have a certain genetic mutation, and a genetic test is 95% accurate in detecting this mutation, what is the probability that a person has the mutation given a positive test result?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "\\[ P(\\text{Mutation|Positive}) = \\frac{P(\\text{Positive|Mutation}) \\times P(\\text{Mutation})}{P(\\text{Positive})} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7: 95% Confidence Interval Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a sample mean of 50, standard deviation of 5, and a sample size of 100, you can use the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\text{Confidence Interval} = \\text{Sample Mean} \\pm \\left(\\text{Critical Value} \\times \\frac{\\text{Standard Deviation}}{\\sqrt{\\text{Sample Size}}}\\right) \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation: We are 95% confident that the true population mean falls within this interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q8: Margin of Error and Sample Size\n",
    "\n",
    "**Margin of Error Example:**\n",
    "Suppose you are conducting a political poll. With a sample size of 500, the margin of error might be ±4%. A larger sample size (e.g., 1000) would result in a smaller margin of error (e.g., ±3%).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q9: Z-Score Calculation and Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a data point value of 75, a population mean of 70, and a population standard deviation of 5:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ Z = \\frac{75 - 70}{5} = 1 \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation: The data point is 1 standard deviation above the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q10: Hypothesis Test for Weight Loss Drug\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a sample mean of 6 pounds, sample standard deviation of 2.5 pounds, and a sample size of 50, you can conduct a t-test to determine if the weight loss is significant at a 95% confidence level.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q11: Confidence Interval for Job Satisfaction Proportion\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of people satisfied with their job using the sample proportion (65%) and the sample size (500).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q12: Hypothesis Test for Teaching Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Perform a t-test using the means, standard deviations, and sample sizes for two teaching methods with a significance level of 0.01.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q13: Confidence Interval for Population Mean\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the 90% confidence interval for the true population mean using the sample mean (65), standard deviation (8), and sample size (50).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q14: Hypothesis Test for Caffeine and Reaction Time\n",
    "\n",
    "Conduct a t-test using the sample mean (0.25 seconds), sample standard deviation (0.05 seconds), sample size (30), and a 90% confidence level to determine if caffeine has a significant effect on reaction time."
