    "Q1. Probability Density Function (PDF) The probability density function is a statistical function that describes the likelihood of obtaining a particular value in a continuous probability distribution. It is often denoted as \\(f(x)\\), and for any interval \\([a, b]\\), the probability that the random variable falls within that interval is given by the integral of the PDF over that interval.\n",

    "Q2. Types of Probability Distribution\n",
    "   - Discrete Probability Distribution Deals with discrete random variables, e.g., binomial, Poisson distributions.\n",
    "   - Continuous Probability Distribution Deals with continuous random variables, e.g., normal distribution.\n",

    "Q7. **Difference between Binomial and Poisson Distribution:**\n",
    "   - Binomial distribution is used when there are a fixed number of independent trials with two possible outcomes.\n",
    "   - Poisson distribution is used when the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space follows a rare, random process.\n",

    "Q10. **Least Frequent Data in Normal Distribution:**\n",
    "   - In a normal distribution, the least frequent data appears in the tails of the distribution, farther from the mean. The tails represent extreme values, and data becomes less frequent as you move away from the mean in either direction."
