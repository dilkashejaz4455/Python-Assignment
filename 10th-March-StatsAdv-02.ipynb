    "# Q1: Estimation Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimation in statistics involves the use of sample data to make inferences about population parameters. There are two main types of estimation: point estimate and interval estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Point Estimate:\n",
    "   - A point estimate is a single value that is used to approximate a population parameter.\n",
    "   - Example: The sample mean is often used as a point estimate for the population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Interval Estimate:\n",
    "   - An interval estimate provides a range of values within which the true population parameter is likely to fall.\n",
    "   - Example: A confidence interval for the population mean provides a range of values within which we are reasonably confident the true mean lies.\n",
