    "   - PMF: Used for discrete random variables. It gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value. For example, in a fair six-sided die, the PMF for getting a 3 is 1/6.\n",
    "   - PDF: Used for continuous random variables. It gives the probability that a continuous random variable falls within a particular range. For example, in a normal distribution, the PDF gives the probability of a random variable falling within a specific interval.\n",

    "Q4: Importance of Normal Distribution:\n",
    "   - Many statistical methods assume normal distribution.\n",
    "   - Simplifies analysis and interpretation.\n",

    "   - Independence: Observations must be independent.\n",
    "   - Sample size: The larger the sample size, the better the approximation to a normal distribution.\n",
